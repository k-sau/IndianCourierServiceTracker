This web app is written in rails, this tracks the courier through iframe if courier company site's don't have X-Frame-Options header available in their response.

# Database

# How to add new courier company data and tracking iframe?
I'll add this in wiki section as soon as I get time.

# Preview
It was costing me lots of bucks for server so currently its not hosting anywhere, but you can see the preview at waybackmachine. Here is the link: http://web.archive.org/web/20160226090833/http://couriertracker.org

# PS
There may/must be lots of bugs in it as this was my first self given project. Let me know if you find any issue :)
